Hello, I'm Sonu Kizhakkepura, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering) and [Department of Chemistry](https://www.umass.edu/chemistry/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). 

As a materials chemist, my primary focus revolves around the intricate design and synthesis of responsive hybrid-soft materials. These materials play a pivotal role in advancing human-centric technologies across biomedical, catalysis, and energy-related applications, underpinning my passion and commitment to pioneering innovations in these fields.
